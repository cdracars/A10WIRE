# 🛠️ A10WIRE – Geeetech A10 CoreXZ Conversion
### by Dracars Designs · maintained by [cdracars](https://github.com/cdracars)

A10WIRE is a fully documented, budget-conscious conversion of the Geeetech A10 3D printer into a CoreXZ machine inspired by the Voron Switchwire and Enderwire projects. Designed with progressive upgrade phases, this project allows hobbyists to reuse stock components while transitioning toward a Klipper-powered, enclosed printer.

> ⚙️ **Open Source. Built in public. Modular by design.**

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- 🔁 Reuse stock GT2560 board, LCD, 3D Touch probe (initial phase)
- ✅ Convert to CoreXZ using Enderwire-style mechanics
- 📦 Add enclosure and external electronics in later phases
- ✍️ Fully documented design, firmware, BOMs, teardown, and testing

---

## 🔄 Working Phases

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | CoreXZ motion w/ stock electronics, open-frame |
| 2     | Klipper board + toolhead upgrade (e.g. Manta + CB1) |
| 3     | Flexplate & frame bracing |
| 4     | Full enclosure (ACM/acrylic) + wiring |
| 5+    | QoL mods (nozzle cleaning, CANbus, camera, auto-off) |
